# Handwritten Numbers Classification Model - Convolutional Neural Network

## Project Overview
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained with the MNIST data set to recognize handwritten numbers. This project further tested this model by uploading pictures of handwritten numbers, scaling the pictures, and then feeding them to the CNN.
