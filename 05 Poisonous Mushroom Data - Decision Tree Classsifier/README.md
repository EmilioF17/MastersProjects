# Poisonous Mushrom Data - Decision Tree Classsifier

## Overview
This script analyzes a data set that contains samples of several mushroom types and their physical attributes. A Decision Tree Classifier was used to predict if a mushroom would be poisonous or not depending on its physical attributes.

## Instructions  

1. **Clone the Repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmilioF17/MastersProjects.git
   cd MastersProjects/"05 Poisonous Mushrom Data - Decision Tree Classsifier"

2. **Run Script**
   
   Run the script named: **Poisonous Mushrom Data - Decision Tree Classsifier**. This script will retrieve data from the csv file saved within this folder and then create a Decision Tree Classifier. Note that the objective of this project was to also determine how limiting the depth of the decision tree can affect the accuracy results, yet making it easier to understand.
