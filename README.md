# Masters Projects Repository  

## Overview  
This repository includes ten projects I completed while enrolled in a Master's in Data Science. Each folder in this repository includes an R or Python file, a PDF file created from the R or Python script, one or multiple data sets, and a `README.md` file. The `README.me` files explain the main purpose of each project and the requirements to run each program.  

I purposely avoided updating and re-formatting my first projects because I wanted to showcase (and always remember) the progress from Project 1 to my final capstone projects. This is just the beginning of a long career in data science. 

## List of Projects  

1.	**Weather Forecast - Python Program:**
    
    This Python-based weather forecast program allows users to enter a location (ZIP code, city name, units of measurement, etc.) and receive the current weather forecast. The program fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  	
2.	**Forecast of Almond Production Using Linear Regression in R:**
    
    This project uses a linear regression in R that measures the relationship between California’s almond production and other variables like planted acres and precipitation levels.
  	
3.	**Correlation Between Treasury Yields & the S&P 500:**
    
    This project uses several methods – from plotting histograms to running linear regressions – to measure the relationship between US Treasury Yields and the S&P 500 stock market index.
  	
4.	**House Prices - Data Wrangling HTML, APIs, & CSVs:**
    
    This project anlayzes and visualizes historical home prices in the United States. The data used for this project was scrapped from JSON, HTML, and CSV files. The main objective of this project was to showcase my capability to work with different types of data.
  	
5.	**Poisonous Mushrom Data - Decision Tree Classsifier:**
    
    This script analyzes a data set that contains samples of several mushroom types and their physical attributes. A Decision Tree Classifier was used to predict if a mushroom would be poisonous or not depending on its physical attributes.
  	
6.	**Single Family Home Price Forecast - SARIMA:**
    
    This project aims to analyze the historical performance of single home values in several cities in the United States and create a model that can forecast the valuation of the same asset type in a specific city.  

7.	**Movie Recommender Program - Cosine Similarity:**
    
    The objective of this project is to create a movie recommender program. A movie dataset from GroupLens was utilized. This dataset includes the name, year of release, and genre(s) of thousands of movies.
   	
8.	**Almond Pricing Forecast - Linear & Ridge Regressions:**
    
    The objective of this project is attempt to forecast almond prices utilizing a linear regression. Almond historical production & prices and US population data were obtaiend from the USDA. In addtion, the US Dollar Index data, which calculates the strength of the dollar against major currencies, was obtained from Finance Yahoo
   	
9.	**Wine Quality Score Classifier - Random Forest Classifier and GridSearch:**
   
    The objective of this project is to use historical wine quality tests data to create a model that can forecast quality scores based on wine physical attributes.
   	
10.	**Handwritten NUmbers Classification Model - Convulational Neural Network:**
