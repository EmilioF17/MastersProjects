# Masters Projects Repository

## Overview  
This repository contains ten projects I completed while enrolled in a Master's in Data Science program. Each folder includes a script written in either R or Python, a PDF output created from the script, one or more datasets, and a `README.md` file. Each `README.md` provides a summary of the projectâ€™s goals and instructions to run the program.

I purposely chose not to revise or reformat my early projects, as they reflect my learning journey from beginner to capstone level. This repository represents the foundation of a lifelong career in data science.

## List of Projects  

1. **Weather Forecast â€“ Python Program**  
   A Python program that allows users to input a location (ZIP code, city name, units of measurement, etc.) and receive the current weather forecast. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time data.

2. **Forecast of Almond Production Using Linear Regression in R**  
   Uses linear regression in R to explore the relationship between California almond production, planted acreage, and precipitation levels.

3. **Correlation Between Treasury Yields & the S&P 500**  
   Analyzes the relationship between U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&P 500 using various techniques such as histogram plotting and linear regression.

4. **House Prices â€“ Data Wrangling HTML, APIs, & CSVs**  
   Analyzes and visualizes historical home prices in the U.S. using data scraped from HTML, JSON, and CSV files. Demonstrates skills in handling diverse data sources.

5. **Poisonous Mushroom Data â€“ Decision Tree Classifier**  
   Builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

6. **Single Family Home Price Forecast â€“ SARIMA**  
   Uses SARIMA models to analyze and forecast single-family home values in various U.S. cities based on historical trends.

7. **Movie Recommender Program â€“ Cosine Similarity**  
   Implements a movie recommender system using cosine similarity, based on a GroupLens dataset with movie titles, genres, and release years.

8. **Almond Pricing Forecast â€“ Linear & Ridge Regressions**  
   Forecasts almond prices using linear and ridge regression. Data sources include USDA almond production/pricing, U.S. population, and the U.S. Dollar Index from Yahoo Finance.

9. **Wine Quality Score Classifier â€“ Random Forest & GridSearch**  
   Develops a Random Forest Classifier with GridSearch optimization to predict wine quality scores based on chemical properties.

10. **Handwritten Numbers Classification Model â€“ Convolutional Neural Network**
   This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the trained model is used to predict custom images of digits saved locally.
