# Masters Projects Repository  

## Overview  
This repository includes ten projects I completed while enrolled in a Master's in Data Science. Each folder in this repository includes an R or Python file, a PDF file created from the R or Python script, one or multiple data sets, and a `README.md` file. The `README.me` files explain the main purpose of each project and the requirements to run each program.  

I purposely avoided updating and re-formatting my first projects because I wanted to showcase (and always remember) the progress from Project 1 to my final capstone projects. This is just the beginning of a long career in data science. 

## List of Projects  

1.	**Weather Forecast Program:**  
   This is a weather forecast program that takes input from the user (zip code, city name, units of measurement, etc.). Then, this program returns the weather forecast of a location that matches the user’s input.
  	
2.	**Forecast of Almond Production Using Linear Regression in R:**  
   This project uses a linear regression in R that measures the relationship between California’s almond production and other variables like planted acres and precipitation levels.
  	
3.	**Treasury Yields and S&P 500 EDA:**  
   This project uses several methods – from plotting histograms to running linear regressions – to measure the relationship between US Treasury Yields and the S&P 500 stock market index.
  	
4.	**Preparing Data with SQL, HTML, and API:**  
   This project recollects data from three different sources using SQL, HTML, and APIs and merges them together.
  	
5.	**Linear Regression & Decision Tree - Train & Mushroom Data:**  
    This project uses linear regression to measure the relationship between variables in the Train data set. Also, it attempts to classify poisonous mushrooms using a decision tree model.
  	
6.	**Housing Prices Forecast – SARIMA:**  
    This project utilizes a SARIMA model to forecast single-family home prices in specific regions within the United States.
   	
7.	**Movie Recommender Program:**  
    This project uses cosine similarity to create a movie recommender program.
   	
8.	**Almond Pricing - Linear & Ridge Regressions:**  
    This program uses linear and Ridge regressions to forecast the pricing of California almonds.
   	
9.	**Final Milestone 2: To be determined.**
